    <h2>Happy Birthday!</h2>
    <p>To Jresmail, </p>
	<p> Hello! I hope this message finds you surrounded by the warmth and joy that birthdays bring, even though my wishes are fashionably late. I owe you a big apology for the tardiness; the chaos of school took over, and I lost track of time. Thanks for being patient and understanding—I'm lucky to have someone as awesome as you who gets it. </p>
<p> Your birthday means the world to me, and even if you say it's no big deal, I can't help but celebrate the incredible person you are. Turning 24 is a milestone, and I'm beyond grateful to be a part of your journey. You don’t understand when I tell you that you need to be celebrated! Because you are THE BEST! </p>
<p> Langga, thank you for existing and for loving me despite my attitude. I love you so much, and I hope you know, and never forget that! Because I never forget that you love me, I can feel it radiating in your every action, and I am very thankful for that. </p>
<p> On your birthday, I find it ironic that, despite it being your special day, I was the one who received an incredible gift because I have you. You, my dear Langga, are the most precious present I could ever ask for. I genuinely hope that you see me as a gift too, and that I bring you as much joy as you bring into my life. Because I don't plan on leaving you. I will be with you until the end because that's how I love you. </p>
<p> As you celebrate another year of life, I encourage you to embrace self-love. It saddens me that you do not fully see the remarkable person I see in you. Every facet of your being is lovable, and I hope you can appreciate and love yourself more. You should be proud, langga! You are truly extraordinary, and I love every aspect of you. </p>
<p> From your kindness--- in taking care of things that don’t matter to some like caring for the hairless dog, the jerk who threw us under the bus, your family even your nephew who shat on the store, and for loving me despite the insults I’ve told you. Your laughter---especially when your voice raises, your eyes shrinks and you call me langga while hugging me. You are one of the best views that I have seen and you never cease to amuse me. Your naughtiness and overall personality---the reasons why I fell for you is simply because of you. Your values and the way you navigate life with such grace, positivity, and goodness—it all makes the lives of people around you brighter and better. </p>
<p> May the coming days be filled with joy, health, success, and moments that take your breath away. I wish for you to tackle challenges with the same determination and spirit that I've come to love about you. Let this be a year of growth, both personally and in our relationship, and may it bring us even closer. Lang, I hope you achieve your dreams, and even if you don’t, do not worry because I will still be there for you and I’ll be proud, because I know you have done your best. And that’s all that matters. Nevertheless, I am not worried because I know you can do it, ikaw pa, langga na gud na nako! </p>
<p> I'm sorry for not being there in person to celebrate, but I want you to know my thoughts and love are with you. Cheers to you, to us, and the countless adventures ahead. Thanks for being my rock, my langga, and my everything. </p>
<p> Wishing you the happiest of birthdays and an even more incredible year ahead. </p>
<p> With all my love,
<p>Nina Andrea V. (Apiledo nimo haha)</p>

    <h2>Poem</h2>
    <p>You are the love of my life, a radiant light,</p>
 <p>Guiding me through the darkest night.</p>
 <p>The best, the handsomest, my heart's true delight,</p>
 <p>In your presence, everything feels just right. </p>
<p>                                       


</p>
<p>In your awesomeness, a brilliance that shines,</p>
 <p>A constellation of virtues, like celestial signs.</p>
 <p>A charm so magnetic, in every line,</p>
 <p>Drawing me close, our fates entwine.</p>
<p>                                       


</p>
<p>I love you deeply, more than words can express,</p>
 <p>A profound emotion, impossible to suppress.</p>
 <p>For your love, my flaws, you graciously undress,</p>
 <p>Unveiling acceptance, in your tenderness.</p>
<p>                                       


</p>
<p>You're my rock, my anchor, in your embrace,</p>
 <p>A sanctuary where worries find no space.</p>
 <p>Thank you for being awesome, filling every place,</p>
 <p>In your love, I find solace and grace.</p>

    <h2>Your Name</h2>
    <p>Joyful spirit, a laughter that's contagious,</p>
<p>Radiating warmth, making moments precious.</p>
<p>Ever resilient, facing challenges with ease,</p>
<p>Smiles that bring comfort, a gentle breeze.</p>
<p>Munificent in generosity, kindness flows free,</p>
<p>Adventurous soul, exploring life with glee.</p>
<p>Inspiring others with a genuine grace,</p>
<p>Loyal and true, a friend in every embrace.</p>
